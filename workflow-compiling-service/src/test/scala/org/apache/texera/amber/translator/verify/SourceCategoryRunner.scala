  * format is verified the moment it appears in [[LogicalOp]]'s `@JsonSubTypes`.
  * A source that cannot take the shared table — the text family emits a single
  * `line` column, and some carry their data inline — keeps a hand-written
  * [[SourceHandler]] instead. Anything else is flagged, never silently skipped.
  *
  * The runner itself is operator-agnostic: it builds an OpDesc, drives
  * [[OpExecHarness]] (Path A) and [[StandaloneRunner]] (Path B), compares via
  * [[Comparator]]. Sources have no input ports so `inputs = Map.empty` for both.
