/**
  * Reads every operator's generated code and reports one that writes to the
  * frame it was handed.
  *
  * The translator names a variable per output PORT, not per reader, so two
  * operators drawn from one upstream are handed the same name. An operator that
  * drops rows into that name, or assigns a column through it, changes what the
  * other branch goes on to read: a bar chart that drops its own nulls would
  * leave a pie chart beside it drawing a table it never received.
  *
  * Both spellings of the mistake matter, and one of them does not look like a
  * mistake. `inplace=True` mutates the frame outright. `in1df = in1df.dropna()`
  * reads like a local rebinding, but the operator bodies are concatenated at
  * module scope, so the name it rebinds is the shared one.
  *
  * A single-branch workflow never notices either, which is why this reads the
  * code rather than waiting for a run to disagree. Every fixture the runner
  * builds has one reader, so a comparison of the two paths agrees while the
  * frame is being altered underneath a branch that the fixture does not have.
  *
  * What reading the code cannot see is a mutation through another name: bind
  * the frame to something else first and the writes below are invisible here.
  * No operator does that today, and an operator that starts to would be saying
  * something a reader has to work out anyway.
